Two basic pieces of advice:

Don't "paste in" references to the readings. Use the theories to help you find the aspects of the game that can help you write a paper that makes a novel contribution to our understanding of games.

Wikipedia is a good place to start, but it's not a quotable source. Go to the sources that the Wikipedia cites.

You now know the due dates of both assignments, which means you can make an appointment at the writing center well in advance. If you feel unsure about your writing, please visit the writing center!
